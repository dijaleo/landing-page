# Landing page project

This is my attempt at making the landing page project from [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

I know the style sheet is a bit of a mess; though i got it to display the way I wanted, any suggestions are welcome.

If you have any problem with any of the pictures used, please reach out.

# Personal notes

Final project with CSS before moving onto JavaScript with the help of [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Hopefully I'll be able to create something that looks decent with my current knowldege.

Feeling confident and not so confident at the same time lol.
